                <h3>Appendix - Housing Quality of Living Index Calculation</h3>
                <p>
                  Calculation of Housing Quality of Living Index - Household quality of living (HQL) refers to three broad aspects including housing condition, amenities and assets.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To assess the household quality of living only for Indian states, a Household Quality of living Index (HQLI) is constructed on the basis of 20 variables. Here, Union Territories (UTs) are excluded to equalize the parity of the states. HQLI is made up of three distinctive indices such as quality of housing index (QHI), basic amenity index (BAI) and asset index (AI). The selected 20 variables fall under these three indices.
                </p>
                <p><strong>HQLI = QHI + BAI + AI</strong></p>

              In this project, we delve into Indian housing data, looking at the 2011 Indian Housing Census Data as well as house data from India's metropolite cities. The exploratory data analysis section of the project answers several questions regarding houses in India for the year 2011 and presents some interesting statistics. Predictive modelling of housing prices in India's metro cities, including Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Kolkata, and Hyderabad, is covered in the second section, which is modelling. To compare and pick which model is most suited to our situation, we train linear models, tree-based models, distance-based models, and neural network-based models. We then explain the best model using several approaches.
